## Functions to calculate the inverse of a matrix using caching

## makeCacheMatrix creates a list containing 4 functions
## set - sets the value of the matrix
## get - gets the value of the matrix
## setinverse - sets the inverse of the matrix
## getinverse - gets the inverse of the matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## cachSolve calculates the inverse of a matrix
## uses the cached version of the inverse if it has already been calculated

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
